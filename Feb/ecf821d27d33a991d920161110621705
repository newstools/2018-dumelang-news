Free State Department of Education MEC, Tate Makgoe, sent his condolences to the Motsitsi's family and Reseamohetse School in Theunissen, earlier this week, after learning of the passing of a female teacher, Sarah Motsitsi (26). According to a statement released by Makgoe, Motsitsi was shot dead by her ex-boyfriend on Wednesday.“I am reeling with shock and saddened by this sudden passing of such a great teacher,” said Makgoe. Last year, Motsitsi won the National Teaching Award in the Technology Category at Provincial and National level and received a car from Vodacom as one of her prizes. She joined  Reseamohetse School in 2015,  teaching mathematics. The school describes Motsitsi as hard working, energetic, valuable and helpful. She was loved by learners, teachers and parents.“We have lost a great teacher and future leader,” said Makgoe. The family is still finalizing funeral arrangements.
