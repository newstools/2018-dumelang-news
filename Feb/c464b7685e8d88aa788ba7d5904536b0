Police watchdog Ipid has not ruled out the possibility of further suspects being arrested. This comes after former acting police commissioner Lieutenant General Kgomotso Phahlane and two co-accused being charged with fraud and corruption worth R900,000. The lieutenant-general, his wife and car dealer Durandt Snyman appeared in the Pretoria Commercial Crimes Court on Thursday. The trio were released on R10,000 bail each. The charge sheet lists six cars which Phahlane and his wife, Beauty, were in possession of over a period spanning seven years. The cars include a Land Rover Discovery, Mercedes Benz C-Class Sedan, as well as two bakkies bought from or sponsored by Snyman. The State alleges that the vehicles were a form of gratification given to the couple. The case has been postponed until March.
