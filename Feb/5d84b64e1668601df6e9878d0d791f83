The Hawks have arrested three people for alleged corruption in respect of the Vrede farm investigations. In a statement on Wednesday morning, the Hawks said two other suspects are expected to hand themselves over to police. “So far, three people have been arrested and two other suspects are expected to hand themselves over to the Hawks. Operations are still ongoing and further details will be made available at a later stage,” the Hawks said. The specialised crime-fighting unit, however, did not reveal the names of those arrested. The arrests follow this morning’s swoop on the premises of the controversial Gupta family in Saxonwold, northern Johannesburg. The Gupta family has been implicated in wide-ranging allegations of corruption, including at Krynaauwslust farm in Vrede in the Free State. The dairy farm matter is at the centre of the R220 million allegedly paid to the controversial Gupta family and companies linked to their businesses, which was intended for black farmers. The Hawks last month raided Free State Premier offices and the provincial office of the Department of Agriculture in Bloemfontein offices. Last month, the Bloemfontein High Court granted an order to freeze assets amounting to R220 million of those who have been linked to the probe. Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane released a report last month, which highlighted irregularities, gross misconduct and maladministration by the Free State Agriculture Department in its handling of the project. The Hawks investigation into the farm is ongoing. Hawks officials are currently investigating various premises around Gauteng.
