Central University of Technology's (CUT) Ixias and the Shimlas from University of Free State registered vital home wins in the third round of the Varsity Cup on Monday and will be looking to see more of that coming their way as the competition progresses. The opening match of the day was at the CUT Rugby fields, where the winless sides - the Ixias and the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, Madibaz - battled out for maximum points to move away from the danger zone. Despite both sides scoring five tries apiece on the day, it was the hosts who narrowly got the better of Madibaz 38-37 to open their home account with a bang. They will undoubtedly be thrilled with the performance they displayed, particularly having to come back from 22-15. The win, which moved CUT to seventh spot with five points from three matches, was also the Ixias' second ever in the Varsity Cup. They will be targetting the same commendable performance they displayed on home soil to add more wins this year. It was also Madibaz's second straight loss in as many matches so far this season. Hooker Tiaan Erasmus, who crossed the whitewash twice for the Ixias on the day, earned himself the Player That Rocks title for his general superb play in the tight and loose phases. On the other side of town, the Shimlas halted Wits' winning run with a 44-24 win to move to the fourth on the table. They are now preparing to face University of Cape Town - Ikeys while CUT travel to Stellenbosch to face log leaders, Maties on Monday, February 19.
