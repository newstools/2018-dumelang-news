ANCWL in the Free State tight-lipped on provincial leadership preferences ahead of province’s ruling party elective conference scheduled for April this year. According to the party’s women wing provincial chairperson Olly Mlamleli, the league will only pronounce its position on leadership preferences after all structures havebeen met and discussions conducted. She however, could not deny nor confirm whether the league will rally support behind one of the their own – Free State MEC for sport, arts and culture Mathabo Leeto whose campaign to replace the newly elected party’s secretary-general Ace Magashule as the provincial chairperson, runs in full swing.“I cannot say the comrade (Mathabo) Leeto has jumped the gun by setting her campaign in motion to take over the province’s powerful office because as we speak, the league has not yet discussed the matter. She is our member and serve in the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the league… she also has the right to elect or be elected as our constitution stipulate,” said Mlamleli. This comes after Leeto – through a group known as ML18 – thrown her hat in the race to become the first provincial female chairperson last week. It is, however, expected that Leeto will face-off with – among others – former Mangaung mayor Thabo Manyoni who also served as provincial deputy chair during Magashule term. Leeto’s interest follows last year’s Bloemfontein High court ruling in December that declared the Parys elective conference null and void… leading to ANC’s national executive committee (NEC) – the highest decision-making structure between conferences – resolved during its lekgotla to dissolve the provincial executive committee (PEC). However, the party has put in place the interim structure led by former Motheo regional secretary Paseka Nompondo and former provincial secretary William Bulwane as convenor and coordinator respectively to oversee the day-to-day running of party business.
