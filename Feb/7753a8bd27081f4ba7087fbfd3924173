“Why are men attracted to women’s legs??” When you wrap them around him. Whether you're giving him a full-body hug or cuddling in bed or doing something else in bed, there's nothing like feeling your legs wrapped around his waist. It's sexy, it's adorable. How smooth they are right after you shave -  Guys over the age of 12 don't care if you have leg hair, but that feeling of a freshly shorn leg ... there's nothing like it. Lady calves -  They're beautiful. We don't get the same definition and curves to our legs. Yours are like rolling hills made of skin, except less weird-sounding. They're instrumental in most sex positions- Doggy-style, cowgirl, and countless others mean we get to constantly see and touch your legs. Two words - thick thighs. And thin ones. And regular ones. Female thighs are basically the most beautiful sex handles ever. Getting to pull off your pantyhose and stockings - For you, it might just be another (annoying) layer of clothing, but for us, it's kind of exciting (except when your foot gets stuck in the end, and we have to stand up and really pull.)
