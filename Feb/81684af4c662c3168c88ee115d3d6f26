South Africa defeated India by 6 wickets and levelled the T20 series 1-1 at Supersport Park in Centurion on Wednesday.Indian batsman Manish Pandey on Wednesday praised the bowling attack of South Africa, saying that they created pressure at times."We are looking forward for a good game in Cape Town. South Africa bowled very well today. It's good to be one each. We will try to improve our game in the third T-20 and try to win the game," said Pandey while addressing the press conference after the match. With this win, South Africa remained alive in the series, with the third T20 match at Cape Town set to be the decider. South African batsman Heinrich Klassen was declared the Man of the Match for his blistering 69 off 30 balls, laced with seven sixes and three fours. The South Africans surpassed a tough 189-run target with eight deliveries to spare, beating the opposition and the rain that had threatened the entire innings. Relatively early departures for openers Reeza Hendricks and Jon-Jon Smuts didn't perturb Duminy and Klaasen, who shared a convincing 93-run stand inside nine overs. "Klaasie got us ahead of the game," said Duminy. "We weren't sure whether we would be coming off. In the end it worked in our favour.""It was a tough one for the bowlers," said India captain Virat Kohli, who said he had no complaints about the umpires keeping the players on the field. India's women, meanwhile, secured an unassailable two-one series lead over their South African counterparts on Wednesday, when the penultimate T20I at SuperSport Park was washed out.
