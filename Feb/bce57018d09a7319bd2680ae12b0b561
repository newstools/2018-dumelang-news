Disability does not signal inability. A fourty year old Solomon Nkosi who's totally blind told Dumelang News yesterday. Nkosi who hails in Phuthaditjhaba, Qwaqwa said at the age of four, he has been unfortunate to contact a measles which was diagnosed very late by the doctors. "Unfortunately a left eye was already affected, " he said. Nkosi said he went to the optometrist trying to stop damage from spreading, but the doctor had damaged another eye. A father of two said he grew up with blindness from the age of four and he accepted. "It has been possible for me to accept that I won't be able to see anymore because the problem came to me at the young age," he said. He added that he grew up wanted to work directly with the community development. He said :" I had to drop out of school due to the financial crisis, but now I have registered again and study a BA degree in community development. I have learnt that leaving a life of disability without qualification will be too difficult for me".Nkosi further mentioned that he's happy to be blind because if he was able to see, he wouldn't be a person he is today."Maybe I should have been in jail for several crime activities I committed because anything is possible to a person who's able to see," he revealed.He urged parents to expose their kids and let them attend school."No one chose to be disabled, and most of all, there are different talents disabled people have," concluded Nkos
