PRETORIA - The quality of referees in the PSL has come under the sport light again following an incident inside the box when Sundowns was playing Free State Stars on Wednesday evening at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria. In the last minute of stoppage time, Nhlanhla Vilakazi was brought down by Sundowns goalkeeper, Denis Onyango, during a one-on-one situation, to what was clearly seemed to be a penalty for the Free State outfit, which was furthered echoed by the television commentators. However, referee Thando Ndzandzeka saw nothing wrong and the two teams shared the points after playing to a one all draw.In 2015/16 Ndzandzeka was named referee of the season and he made his PSL debut in 2011/12, where he officiated the clash between Ajax Cape Town and Golden Arrows. Since he started his career the 38 year old referee has enjoyed a clean record until Wednesday’s incident.Speaking to the SABC yesterday, the Manager of Free State Stars, Rantsi Mokoena, told Lesedi FM’s Thabo Kofa that his team could have beaten the African Champions in their backyard. “It is my opinion that we should have come back home yesterday with three points, when looking at the penalty we should have been awarded,” said Mokoena. According to him, it was clear on TV that Onyango committed a foul in the penalty area.“It might not be intentional, but I think the referee got it wrong this time.Should Stars have won the match, they would have moved into second position with 35 points behind the leaders Mamelodi Sundowns. Despite the draw on Wednesday, Ea Lla Koto is well placed on fourth position in the PSL log after 21 games.   Tomorrow, Stars will be welcoming AmaZulu at Goble Park, kick-off is at 20:15.
