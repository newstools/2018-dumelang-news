Love was in the air on the 14th of February as Dumelang Media partnered with Sun Windmill to give away a few tickets to some lucky entrants to dine at the Windmill Boulevard event Wednesday evening. It was a momentous occasion that truly encapsulated the meaning of love for some, that included fine dining and drinks, the combination of which resulted in a bouquet of romance and splendour. But do we really know what lies behind this day in history? Valentine's Day is named after Saint Valentine, a Catholic priest who lived in Rome in the 3rd Century. There are many stories about St Valentine and over time these stories grew into the legend we know today. At the time of Valentine's life, many Romans were converting to Christianity, but the Emperor Claudius II was a pagan and created strict laws about what Christians were allowed to do. Claudius believed that Roman soldiers should be completely devoted to Rome and therefore passed a law preventing them from marrying. St Valentine began to marry these soldiers in secret Christian ceremonies and this was the beginning of his reputation for believing in the importance of love. Eventually, Valentine was found out and jailed for his crimes against Claudius. While imprisoned, Valentine cared for his fellow prisoners and also his jailor's blind daughter. Legend has it that Valentine cured the girl's blindness and that his final act before being executed was to write her a love message signed â€˜from your Valentine'. Valentine was executed on 14 February in the year 270.
