Police have managed to restore calm after five hours of clashes by irate  residents of Phase7 in Mangaung Bloemfontein this morning. Motorist and taxis woke-up on Monday morning with shock after residents barricaded the R702 road to Dewetsdorp near Grootvlei Prison with stones and burning tyres around 4:30am protesting over poor service delivery in the area. They (residents) accused the Mangaung Metro Municipality of empty promises for the past two years which led to them taking to the streets to express their anger. At the time of  Dumelang News’ arrival in the area, a few police nyalas and vans were seen patrolling the district and smoke from the burning tyres and teargas had tainted the normally fresh morning air while municipal bulldozers were clearing the road. Papi Moorosi told Dumelang News that they have been requesting water, electricity, roads and sewage connection in the area for years. “Our plea to the Municipality seem to fell on deaf ears… they keep promising us services with no action,” he said. Police Spokesperson Colonel Thandi Mbambo said 11 people have been arrested this morning and Public Order Police (POP) was sent to the area to monitor the situation further. Another resident Tshidiso Kabi accused the police of blocking the way to raising their grievances with the municipality. “We have been shot with rubber bullets and doused by teargas while  we try to fight for our rights for a better life. The municipality instead of addressing our concerns, sent police to harass us and chase us like we are criminals,” said Kabi. Dumelang’s attempts to get comment from Mangaung Municipality Spokesperson Qondile Khedama before going to print, drew blank as he promised to return the call when contacted for comment but did not.
