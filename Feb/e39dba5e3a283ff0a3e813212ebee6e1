The Department of Home Affairs has confirmed a raid at the offices of ANN7’s television station’s offices in Midrand, north of Johannesburg, according to the SABC.  It says this is part of its investigation into allegations that certain employees from India, who are employed by the company do not have the necessary work permits.The company, launched in the past few years, was owned by the beleaguered Gupta family before former government spokesperson Mzwanele Manyi assumed ownership.The Gupta family is currently embroiled in allegations of state capture. Home Affairs Spokesperson Mava Scott says they were following up on the information they received.“In this regard, our officials visited the ANN7 premises to verify the information relating to visas of certain individuals that are employed by the organisation concerned. Once verified the department will then release the findings of the inspection.” Meanwhile, work at the Gupta-owned Optimum Coal Mine in Mpumalanga came to a standstill on Wednesday as workers marched to hand over a memorandum of grievances to CEO George van der Merwe.The mine supplies coal to power utility Eskom for its power generation.National Union of Mineworkers spokesperson Livhuwani Mammburu said its members wanted answers on the future of the mine because of reports that the mine’s owners, the Gupta family, could no longer be found. On Thursday the Hawks reiterated that they are in possession of a warrant of arrest for Ajay Gupta and that it will be executed.  Gupta attorney, Rudi Krause said that since Sunday he has been asking the investigating officer to provide him with case numbers and a copy of the arrest warrant but to no avail.
