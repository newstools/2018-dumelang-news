David Kgabale is, again this year, breathing the same word of ensuring table tennis grows in leaps and bounds in the Free State particularly in Bloemfontein and the upcoming tournament will yet again assist in achieving that. Kgabale, the organiser of the upcoming Caleb Motshabi Table Tennis Tournament, is thrilled with the quality of the sport and the interest it attracts, saying it continues to be a recognised sport. "We're hoping to see new talent and the tournament growing further than last year," he told Dumelang Sport.  He continued: "We'd also like to urge p arents to support their children by attending their games and in that way they contribute to the growth of table tennis in the province." "One of the highlights we endured last year was bringing a team from Northern Cape in what was an exciting tournament. So, we're hoping to achieve the same this year." Preparations are well underway for the first Caleb Motshabi tournament set to take place in week's time and Kgabale is hoping to endure the same successes as last year. He also called on players to join the tournament and take the sport to new heights.  Dr. Molemela Stadium Indoor Sport Centre will play hosts to the table tennis battle of the u/13, u/15 and u/18 boys and girls teams on Saturday, March 10.
