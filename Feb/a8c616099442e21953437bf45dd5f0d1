Police in Phuthaditjhaba have been on high alert since Tuesday night in what they call a ‘war room’ where all stakeholders converge in one room so as to stay alert for any emergency that may exist. According to police spokesperson, Sergeant Mmako Mophiring, this comes amid what police referred to as criminality disguised as a service delivery protest in Maluti-A-Phofung local municipality on Tuesday. The men and women in blue have issued a strong warning to those who had their hand in the destruction of public property. Mophiring told Dumelang News on Wednesday that as members of the SAPS they would not leave any stone unturned in ensuring that all those who were involved in destroying  municipal information banners and electricity vending outlets were brought to book. “We have ensured that all stakeholders, which included our traffic counterparts and medical emergency services, are on high alert in case of any incidents that may erupt as a result of the criminality that some want to create, leaving the community under the impression that there was a protest,” said Mophiring. He said according to procedures, if there was a genuine protest, there would have been a march from point A to point B where a memorandum of grievance would be handed to officials intended for, but since none of that has happened, from a policing perspective, they have seen the incidents as criminality. He confirmed that there is a group of gangsters that they have identified that seems to be taking advantage of the situation and, as a result, go around robbing and looting shops and businesses around Phuthaditjhaba.
