World champion, Justin Gatlin - who owns three world sprint titles including an Olympic title, has joined the list of world class athletes who will be competing at the much-awaited Athletix Grand Prix Series in March 2018. Gatlin, the 2017 World 100m champion and the fifth fastest human being in the 100m and 200m, will line up in the men’s 150m race at Tuks Stadium (Tshwane) on Thursday, 8 March in the second of the three series meetings. He is the biggest name to compete on South African soil since Michael Johnson in 2001 and is a massive boost to South African athletics. His presence shows once again how far the sport has come and that global champions are again seeing South Africa as a top global player. Meanwhile it’s been reported that London will host a new World Cup event this summer featuring eight top nations including the United States and Jamaica, British Athletics announced on Monday. Britain, the United States, Poland, China, Germany, France, Jamaica and South Africa will compete at the London Stadium on July 14-15. The tournament follows last year's world athletics championships in the British capital, which also hosted the Olympics in 2012.
