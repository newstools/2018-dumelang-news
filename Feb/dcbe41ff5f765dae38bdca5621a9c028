This week, Africa mourns the loss of a revered leader, in Zimbabwe’s Morgan Richard Tsvangirai, after he passed away at the Johannesburg Hospital, following a long battle with cancer. The 65-year-old was seen by many Zimbabweans citizens as an icon and fighter for democracy after he came close to toppling former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe’s authoritarian government, 10 years ago. A Zimbabwean national living in South Africa, known as Madinda Labode, expressed sadness over the passing of the founding president of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), describing him as a true leader whose death came too soon. Labode, who has been living in South Africa, Bloemfontein for the past seven years, said that the country has lost a potential president and selfless leader. “Our country will never produce a leader like him in many years to come. He took on Mugabe without fear, sacrificing his life for the people of Zimbabwe and for that he will always be remembered as a true leader,” said Labode. It is however, expected that his death will be an enormous blow to the opposition party, coming only months before the first elections were due to be held in the former British colony since the end of Mugabe’s near four-decade rule last year. Tsvangirai’s illness – revealed in 2016 – has allegedly divided his party with three deputy leaders and other officials already publicly manoeuvring to succeed him.
