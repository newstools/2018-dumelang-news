Meloding-Members of Meloding SAPS Crime Prevention reclaimed their space in the crime prevention sector when it nabbed men for possession of gold during an Operation Fiela II Reclaim campaign. According to police spokesperson, Captain Malebo Khosana, their members, Sergeant Mothibeli Phakane, Constable Lerotholi Mololo and Constable Kamohelo Sejentu were doing patrols when they received information about a motor vehicle with four occupants who are dealing in gold. “The information became reality when they noticed a motor vehicle fitting the description contained in their information, a green Toyota Yaris with Free State registration number plate, at the circle on the entrance of Meloding. The vehicle was stopped and there were four occupants including the driver in it.  It was searched and Constable Sejentu found a wrapping in a cloth underneath the driver’s seat and unwrapped it to find three gold nuggets,” said Khosana. He added that the driver of the motor vehicle and his passengers were then arrested in connection with this gold, two of them were Lesotho nationals while two were South Africans.  Khosana said one of the Lesotho nationals had no legal documentation to be in South Africa and therefore had to face an additional charge of being an illegal immigrant while the three precious stones and a Toyota Yaris was confiscated by the police for commission of crime. He said the four suspects aged 24, 26, 29 and 32 will appear at Virginia Magistrates’ Court soon.
