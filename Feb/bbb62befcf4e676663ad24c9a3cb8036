Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Justice and Correctional Services has welcomed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s decision to withdraw the appeal at the Constitutional Court against the court ruling that NPA head, Shaun Abrahams, should vacate his position. On Friday evening, President Ramaphosa indicated to the Constitutional Court that he will withdraw the appeal filed in the matter of Corruption Watch and Others v The President of the Republic of South Africa, which concerns the appointment of the National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP). Former president Jacob Zuma had appealed the High Court in Pretoria's ruling last year that Abrahams leave the top post at the NPA. The court ruled that then President Zuma was conflicted in the matter of appointing an NPA head because he faced possible prosecution on corruption charges. Abrahams is still appealing the matter - which goes to court on Wednesday next week. Committee Chairperson Mathole Motshekga said President Ramaphosa’s speedy response to matters since he came into office last week will assist to make the oversight work of the committee easier. “It is clear that we do not have absentee landlord, but who has taken a keen interest in making sure his house is in order.” At its hearing on Wednesday, 28 February 2018, the Constitutional Court will also be considering whether or not to confirm the High Court’s decision that some sections of the National Prosecuting Authority Act – those dealing with suspension of the NDPP - are unconstitutional.
