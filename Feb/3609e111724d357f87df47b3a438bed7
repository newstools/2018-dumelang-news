Preparations for setting up the Commission of Inquiry into State capture are at an advanced stage, Justice Raymond Zondo said on Tuesday. “Pending the publication of the [commission] regulations, I had already begun discussions with some of the potential candidates for appointment to key positions. I will now be finalising these discussions. I estimate that I should be able to make an announcement of these key appointments soon. “The search for appropriate premises for the commission, where it will have its offices and hold its hearings, is also underway. I have no doubt that soon, I will able to make an announcement of where the premises of the commission will be,” Zondo said. The regulations for the inquiry were published in the Government Gazette on 9 February 2018. The regulations enable the chairperson of the commission to collect evidence and subpoena witnesses to testify before the commission and to present any documentary evidence relevant to the inquiry. The publication of the regulation follows the earlier publication of the terms of reference of the commission under Government Gazette No. 41403 of 24 January 2018. Zondo welcomed the publication of the regulations, saying it opens the way to making key appointments in the commission. “These key appointments include the appointment of the secretary of the commission, a team of lawyers who will be evidence leaders, including their leader, and the head of investigations.” The inquiry will investigate allegations of State capture, corruption and fraud in the public sector, including organs of State. In the terms of the reference, the commission must investigate whether, to what extent and by whom, attempts were made, through any form of inducement or for any gain whatsoever to influence members of the National Executive, including Deputy Ministers, office bearers and directors of the boards of SOEs.
