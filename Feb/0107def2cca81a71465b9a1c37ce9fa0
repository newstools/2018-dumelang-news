President Ramaphosa said government has received numerous calls to pay suppliers timeously. “A Mr Ismail Ebrahim wrote to us on Facebook. He said: ‘Mr President, I am a small businessman trying to start a business the honest way. I have been sent from pillar to post for the last seven years between Departments of Water, Energy and the City of Tshwane. I have stood in queues for days and only get excuses or no response at all. My business will create jobs, but the government red tape is stifling our entrepreneurship. Please help’. “The frustration that these entrepreneurs have to endure at the hands of the very State that is supposed to assist them is a matter of great concern.“It is clear that the failure of some government departments to pay suppliers within 30 days has a devastating impact on small and medium-sized businesses. “This is something that I want to see addressed as I visit government departments because the culture of late payment has gone on for far too long and has caused far too much damage, particularly to emerging black businesses.”
