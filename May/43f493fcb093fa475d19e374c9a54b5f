The FSGLTA (Free State Gambling, Liquor and Tourism Authority) formed part of the hugely successful Tourism Indaba 2018, which is South Africa's largest travel occasion. The event was graced by many names of stature and met travellers from all across the globe, to sell South Africa as a travel destination.The Free State stand was one of the spectacular designs and executions, complemented by an array of stunning pictures that encapsulate the true beauty of this province. Delegates from all over FS were there to market their own region and to give life to the stand. Among the festivities, was wine tasting and other events for all who graced the Free State stand. Tourism continues to be one of the fastest growing sectors in the world economy and the entity continues to drive the potential of one of the most beautiful parts of South Africa. The show ran from the 8th to the 10th of May. The successful execution of the exhibition  brings great pride to our province, and the coming years promise to bring tourists with a greater number of people visiting the heart of SA to grow it’s local economy and contribute to job creation said Chairman of  FSGLTA, Dhilosen Pillay whilst talking to Dumelang Media during the INDABA.
