About 105 564 people attended this year’s 10 days of activities at the Bloem Show, with both young and old promising to return for the 2019 show. According to the show’s chief executive officer, Elmarie Prinsloo, this year’s edition proved to be one of the best years since 1883, though attendance was said to be have been lesser than last year.However, her sentiments were echoed by first-time comers who expressed their happiness on the last day of the show. Ntando Makgetha brought her entire family of four on the last day of the show last Saturday. She told Dumelang News that she will never miss another show and will start preparing for next year as early as next month.“It was my first time attending the Blow Show and my family had so much fun. Had I known this was going to one of my family’s best outings ever, I would have been here mu ch earlier,” she said adding that she will never miss a year without attending the Bloem Show. The show started on the 26 April with Prinsloo saying the attendance stood just over 37 thousand people during the launch.“The attendance final tally is 5 percent less than it was in 2017, but this year the show took place over ten days instead of the 11 days as it did in 2017. However, during the first few days, just over 37 thousand people showed up and that has since increased significantly to 60 000 by the sixth day of the show,” she said assuring that next year will be a lot different but more exciting. This show attracted customers and visitors from all over the country, and an average of 350 local, national and international exhibitors, 25 agricultural championships and more than 2 500 creative crafts entries – an enormous economic boost for the region.
