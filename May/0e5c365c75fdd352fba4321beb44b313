Ditaba Mokoena hailed the courage and the performance his team from Tshediso-Xolani Primary School showed in the Danone Nations Cup after becoming the last school standing in the Free State at the Provincial Finals last week. Grey College hosted five schools from various districts to battle for the Free State honours. Xolani and Inoseng were joined by Witsieshoek, Katiso and Letsibolo to fight for the bragging rights of the province in the under 12 tournament. Following gruelling 10 matches played on the day, Inoseng and Xolani progressed to the final after finishing on the first and second spots respectively on the overall standings. But it was the latter that had the final say in penalties after the match ended in 1-all after regulation time. Mokoena lauded his troops for the fighting spirit they displayed following a defeat in the opening match, describing it as a key factor in the success of the school from Tweeling. â€œI give credit to my boys. They fought and never really gave up. We suffered a heavy loss in the opening match, but from there we worked hard," he told Dumelang Sport. "We got those wins and it was good to see that courage from my boys." On beating one of the province's most admired soccer playing schools with rich history as far as the competition is concerned, Mokoena said their focus was more on getting the results and less on the opponents. "Coming here I knew no school. We came here as underdogs, and didn't even know or focus on how which team plays." The same thing happened in the regional stages. We only learned about the school named Nelson Mandela and how competitive they are after we beat them 6-0. We knew nothing about them prior to that, the same thing as Inoseng. So I've got to commend my boys for fighting so hard." The school finished seven points from two wins, a draw and a defeat. They will now await winners from other provincial winners to set up National Finals to take place later this year.
