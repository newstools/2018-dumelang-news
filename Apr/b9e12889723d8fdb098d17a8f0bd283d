“It has been five years now” A Bloemfontein woman is making a plea for the completion of her RDP house which has been standing uncompleted for the past five years.  Lydia Mjezu, a married mother of two, told Dumelang News that she applied for an RDP house back in 2005 and in 2012, she received a call and was told that her house was allocated in Phase Six, house number 14357. Little did Mjezu know that her joy over the new house would be short lived. “Before I could see the house, I was told not to occupy the house as it was not built correctly and needed to be re-built. I have since been waiting for the house to be re-built although my neighbours have occupied theirs long before mine despite having had the same challenge,” she said. The unemployed mother is currently staying in Louriepark, on the outskirt of Bloemfontein, where her husband pays rent of a small monthly fee. “It has been five years now since I have been trying to engage officials at the provincial Human Settlement. Even during the time when Mme Olly Mlamleli was still MEC, I spoke to her about my problem and I received calls from officials who kept on promising me that the matter will be resolved. But till today, I have not been assisted and it seems as if I am going to spend another winter without proper housing,” said the devastated Mjezu. In response to an enquiry by Dumelang News, spokesperson of the Department of Human Settlement, Senne Bogatsu said the department regrets the delay on this matter.“However, please note that we have a programme dedicated to completion of these incomplete houses. The house will be reassessed for structural integrity and be reassigned a contractor in this financial year,” said Bogatsu. While working on Mjezu’s incomplete house debacle, the Dumelang News team learnt that there was more than one resident in Phase Six who were faced with the same predicament of incomplete houses and pleaded with government to intervene.
