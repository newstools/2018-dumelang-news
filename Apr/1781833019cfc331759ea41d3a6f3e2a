Both the poor and the rich must have hope that they will access health care services from private institutions without having to pay upfront and the National Health Insurance will reimburse doctors and hospitals for the services they have rendered, MEC of Health, Butana Khompela said on Wednesday when he delivered the department’s budget vote in a packed local school hall. According to Khompela, the department will endeavour to gradually abolish the province’s two-tier health system through partnerships, cooperation and sharing of resources with the private sector institutions like Medi-Clini c, Rosepark, Netcare as well as privately operating doctors.“This approach is catalytic to the roll-out of NHI Scheme which will be a precursor to the provision of quality healthcare services to all Free State communities, based on the need and irrespective of income,” said the MEC. He said the intended move will be communicated through dialogue with Free State communities on various platforms such as District Municipal Councils, Health Governance Structures, Organised Labour and Private Health Sector. Khompela said the NHI will also be allocated funds from the R10, 403, 313 billion he tabled which was approved by opposition parties during. Amongst other health concerns that Khompela said needed urgent attention was the scourge of cancer. “Cancer is deadly and kills more than HIV/Aids, I am happy that our graduates from Cuba will be returning home in June to be placed in various institutions to help fight this number killer,” he said. He added that many cancer sufferers who can’t afford chemotherapy will also benefit from the new strategy under NHI. He assured the Free State communities that there was no crisis in provincial health care facilities and that he and his team where working around the clock to ensure that there were no casualties.
