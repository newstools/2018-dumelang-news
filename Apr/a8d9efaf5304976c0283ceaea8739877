The Economic Freedom Fighters in the Free State Legislature has made a call to the Department of Health to ensure that health inspectors were also deployed to informal traders usually referred to as "Spaza Shops" that are mostly found in black townships where the unemployed and marginalised afford to shop for basic necessities. EFF member of the Legislature, Mandisa Makeseni, made this plea during the department's budget vote delivered by MEC Butana Khompela's in Kroonstad on Wednesday.Although the MEC acknowledged that listeriosis was a serious matter that is manageable and treatable, he noted that the chicken factory in Sasolburg which was identified as one of the possible sources of listeriosis did not have traces of the diseases which was responsible for the sickness and deaths seen in the last few months. Khompela also urged members of the public to ensure that they, as advised by the World Health Organisation, keep clean and wash their hands before and while preparing food. He said raw and cooked food must be separated and temperatures where food is stored be monitored.The Department of Trade and Industry has estimated that in South African townships, at least 60 percent of local shops were not regulated and attention should be given to such business operations.
