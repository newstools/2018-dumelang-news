Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino does not believe playing at Wembley will give his side an advantage in Saturday's blockbuster FA Cup semifinal against Manchester United.Spurs, playing at Wembley this season while their new stadium is being built, will be on familiar turf, although using the away dressing room, but Pochettino insists it will be a level playing field against Jose Mourinho's side. "Of course, we feel at home," the Argentine said at his pre-match press conference on Thursday. "But it's different to when we play in the Premier League."I don't believe (we will have an advantage) because Manchester United have the experience to play at Wembley too. It's not an event just for us.The other semifinal, on Sunday, sees Chelsea take on relegation-threatened Southampton.
