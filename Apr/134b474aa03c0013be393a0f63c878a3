SMITHFIELD - Elna Mong (57) is passionate about her calling of taking care of orphans living within her community in Smithfield. Mong, a teacher at Smithfield Primary School said that she felt obliged to establish an orphanage home after seeing how the little ones were living. “In 2016 I started the - Tsekiso’s Foster House for Child and Youth Cluster’ - with the aim of taking care of those that needs love the most. We provide to approximately 50 orphanages and neglected children,” said Mong speaking to Dumelang News. “Special care and monitoring of teenagers is our priority and children are encouraged and motivated to complete their grade 12 and apply for educational funding and bursaries for tertiary education,” she added. Every child has the opportunity for both in-door and out-doors recreation-and-play facilities along with training in arts and crafts. The orphanage is currently accommodating 23 orphans between the age of 1 and 19 years and 27 neglected children between the ages of 9 and 14 years. Despite limited resources, Mong said they have recently welcomed more children at the House of hope. She has indicated that with the little that they have, they cannot close the doors “because we understand their hardship and poverty they are coming across with.” She further said “This project require more funding to run it and with more money we can do much better for these children.” According to her, they need over R500 000 to cover the needs and to extend orphanage home. “At this stage, I provide a home and pay electricity, clothing, blankets, food, transport costs, Beds and aftercare services from my own salaries,” said the caring teacher. In a cry for help, she said “we plead to businessmen and the department social development to fund the orphanage home.
