Court papers show that a business agreement was allegedly not followed through by the victim of an alleged hit.A man who was gunned down on Bowling Avenue in Sandton last year has allegedly been identified as businessman Ignatius ‘Igo’ Mpambani.According to the Sandton Chronicle, the man’s death is reportedly linked to an obscure R255m ‘asbestos auditing’ contract with the Free State Department of Human Settlements. The publication had originally reported on an unidentified man driving a Bentley who was shot and killed on 20 June last year.In the incident, four armed suspects gunned down the 37-year-old Mpambani, who died at the scene.Colonel Lungelo Dlamini, spokesperson for the SAPS, told the publication that at the time of his death, the victim was coming from the bank when he was attacked by four suspects. He added that it was unclear if the suspects had taken any money, but that investigations were underway.Mpambani was allegedly one of the main beneficiaries of a controversial contract to ‘audit’ and ‘assess’ houses with asbestos roofs. Documents allegedly obtained by the Sandton Chronicle from the Provincial Department of Human Settlements suggest that there was a joint venture between Gauteng-based engineering consultancy firm Blackhead Consulting and Mpambani’s company, Diamond Hill Trading 71. The companies were awarded a R255m contract in 2014 for the audit and assessment of asbestos housing units in the Free State. Further records from the department show that it had paid the joint venture of  R230m in 10 tranches between the end of 2014 and August 2016.In October last year, Edwin Sodi of Blackhead Consulting took Diamond Hill to court in connection with a final payment of R77.5m made by the Human Settlements Department to the joint venture in late 2016. Sodi claimed the joint venture agreement stipulated that the proceeds would be split in half. However, according to court papers, this did not happen and Mpambani allegedly paid the whole amount into his personal account.Sodi’s lawyer, Sven Laurencik, is reported as saying his client denied any knowledge of the circumstances around Mpambani’s death.
