Since ascending to the top post after replacing ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule these past two weeks, Premier Sefora (Sisi) Ntombela has not touched the subject of a possible reshuffling although she hinted that her administration will not allow laziness in the executive.“I know some of my colleagues in the executive have the capacity to work around the clock but there are tho se who want to be pushed and we don’t have time for that, our people need services here and now,” said Ntombela. DA’s Dr Roy Jankielsohn pleaded with Ntombela to use the opportunity of her imminent cabinet reshuffle to begin sweeping the Free State Executive Committee clean. “The DA is of the strong view that not a single ANC MPL currently serving in the back benches of the ANC in the Free State Provincial Legislature possesses the skills or experience necessary to effectively deal with the problems facing municipalities,” said Jankielsohn. Ntombela is expected to start off with her reshuffling by appointing a successor for the MEC of Cogta position, which has been vacant since she accepted the premier position.Ntombela, who is also the deputy chairperson of the ANC Women’s League and a firm advocate of women in leadership, is expected to increase the quota of female MECs.Ntombela’s spokesperson, Tiisetso Makhele, stated that he was unsure when Ntombela would make her announcement about a cabinet reshuffle.“The decision will be communicated once made,” Makhele said.Although Jankielsohn mentioned former Mangaung mayor, Thabo Manyoni, as well as former Free State ANC provincial treasurer, Mxolisi Dukwana, as suitable candidates for Ntombela’s cabinet, Makhele could not, however, be drawn in the equation
