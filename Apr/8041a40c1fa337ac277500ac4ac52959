The Council Speaker of the Mangaung Metro Municipality, Councillor Mxolisi Siyonzana rubbished all reports claiming that the only metro municipality in the Free State was likely to be placed under Section 139 which is commonly known as “under administration”. Siyonzana spoke to Dumelang News yesterday (Thursday) on the sidelines of a Special Council Meeting held at the Council Chamber in Bloemfontein.These remarks by Siyonzana came in the wake of DA’s Caucus Leader in the metro, Hardie Viviers, submitting a letter to the Free State MEC of Cooperative Governance (COGTA) and Premier, Sisi Ntombela, requesting her to urgently intervene in combating what she said was total collapse of service delivery in the Mangaung Metro. “The narrative that Mangaung Metro is at the brink of collapse is baseless and just a political ploy intended at undermining the efforts that are being put in place to ensure that the city continues to provide basic services despite limited resources,” said Siyonzana. According to Viviers, the DA has requested Ntombela’s intervention in terms of the Municipal Systems Act, however, Siyonzana said at no stage where they informed of any move of putting the municipality under Section 139. “Rather, we have been pro-active to engage our main stakeholders such as the National Treasury and National Department of Human Settlement in our endeavour to ensure that we adhere to our constitutional mandate of delivering basic services to the community of Mangaung,” said Siyonzana. Amongst others, the DA accused the metro of uncollected refuse, water leakages not being repaired and the sewerage leakages which are not being attended to as well as no communication to the public with regards to water supply challenges. Siyonzana went on to say alternative measures are being implemented by administration to attend to backlogs.“We have also established the Rapid Response Team to deal with major water and sewer challenges so that they can respond to queries speedily,” he said.Siyonzana further assured that they have, through the Mothebe Shuttle Services contract, placed orders for five refuse compact trucks, seven back loaders, five vacuum tankers, six sedans and twelve bakkies to a total amount of R49.1 million payable over a period of three years.
