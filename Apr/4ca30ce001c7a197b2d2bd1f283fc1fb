Chris Gayle continued his stellar form with a brutal century to lead the Kings XI Punjab to a daunting total of 193-3 and victory by 15 runs after choosing to bat first in their Indian Premier League match against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Thursday evening.Gayle’s remarkable resurgence continued with an unbeaten innings of 104 from just 63 deliveries which included just a single four – but 11 sixes as he measured his assault with his first 50 coming from a relatively sedate 39 balls, by his standards. But it was KK Nair’s 31 from 21 balls in a third wicket stand of 85 in just 6.2 overs which appeared to take the game away from the Sunrisers for whom Rashid Khan, their star Afghani mystery spinner, conceded a wretched 55 from his four overs.It was the Sunrisers first defeat of the tournament while King’s XI moved to the top of the log with three wins from four games, one less than KKR who also have three victories.Today the highly popular will continue with the Chennai Super Kings taking on the Rajasthan Royals in Pune.
