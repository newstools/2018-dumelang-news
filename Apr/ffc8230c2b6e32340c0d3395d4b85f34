It took him and his team six months to test their market and see if it is worth taking forward, today the business is making its mark in the pizza market.Thaba Nchu entrepreneur, Keorapetse Sebusi shared his journey with Dumelang News. "We started operating Quintos Pizza six months before officially registering the outlet because we first wanted to test the market. We wanted to make sure it’s something that we wanted to do and to check whether it would be profitable,” said Sebusi. Working from a renovated house garage, the business has grown into a reliable fast food outlet competing with big pizza brands. Funding received from the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA) gave Sebusi’s business a boost. The NYDA assisted with equipment including a dough mixer, an under-counter fridge and a conventional restaurant oven. “I’m very grateful for the support and assistance from the NYDA as the funding they gave us was a huge stepping stone in the growth of the business. Our customers are also happy that we are able to deliver on time,” said Sebusi. With an ever-growing clientele Quintos Pizza employs six permanent employees.“We plan to expand the business’s operations to a much bigger and better equipped space,” Sebusi explained. He has dreams to grow the business. “I’d like to see Quintos Pizza as a stable brand and registered as a franchise, but first I want to see it as a fully established food outlet in Thaba Nchu.” Although Quintos Pizza is now a success, Sebusi explained that it wasn’t easy to grow the business. “It’s been almost two years now trying to get this dream of Quintos Pizza alive and it hasn’t been easy, but having patience, perseverance, knowing that in the process there are ups and downs and discipline has pulled us through,” added the motivated entrepreneur.Although Quintos Pizza, sells pizza primarily, it also offers butter chicken and naan, tacos and shawarma “to offer our customers variety”.
