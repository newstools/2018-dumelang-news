While Steve Komphela will be looking to succeed in his final attempt for silverware at Kaiser Chiefs, Luc Eymael on the other hand will be keen to continue his positive run at Free State Stars when the two sides face off in the Nedbank Cup semi-final on Saturday. Both coaches and their respective sides head into the last four clash of the competition in Durban with guns blazing, as they seek to stay hopeful of a title this season despite falling out of the league race. For Chiefs, who are yet to taste silverware under Komphela, they come into the match looking to avoid the record of going three full seasons without a title. They will have a tough task against Ea Lla Koto though, whom they defeated in their league encounter earlier this month. With the situation worsening at the Glamour Boys and pressure mounting for the former Stars mentor, Eymael's name continues to be thrown in as his possible replacement. However, the General Manager at Stars, Rantsi Mokoena neither confirmed nor denied the reports, saying it is nothing new."With regard to the coach possibly going to Chiefs or not, only he and Chiefs have the answer to that. I can say with confidence that Luc will be here [next season], but with the years Ive been in the game I do have a room for disappointment," he said. Eymael, who has led Stars to the fifth spot on the league table, will be in search of not only Stars' first final appearance since 1994, but also his maiden in South Africa. The Bethlehem side has not been in the final since 1994, when they were still called Qwa Qwa Stars while Chiefs last appeared in the final and won it in 2013 under Bafana Bafana coach, Stuart Baxter.Stars defeated Super Eagles, Chippa United and Ubuntu Cape Town while Chiefs saw off Golden Arrows, Stellenbosch and Baroka FC to reach this round. Kickoff at the Moses Mabhida Stadium is at 20:15.
