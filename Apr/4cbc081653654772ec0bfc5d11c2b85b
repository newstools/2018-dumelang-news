Former President Jacob Zuma’s son, Duduzane is to be prosecuted on a culpable homicide charge for a car accident he was involved in, in 2014 – in which one person was killed. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) made the decision after he failed to present a case as to why he should not be prosecuted. Duduzane Zuma’s whereabouts are not known at this stage. His luxury German sports car was involved in a collision with a taxi in Joburg four years ago, that claimed the life of Phumzile Dube.Afriforum’s Gerrie Nel had asked the NPA whether it would prosecute Duduzane. The authority then gave the former President’s son until the end of March to show why he should not be prosecuted.The NPA says Zuma has not responded and the prosecution is now to get underway.
