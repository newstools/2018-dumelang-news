Bethlehem-A reign of terror has been dealt a serious blow following the arrest of three alleged Bohlokong serial burglars. Police spokesperson, Captain Zweli Mohobeleli said two teenage boys (17) and another male (24) were arrested on Thursday, March 22 in Bohlokong. “Properties stolen during a spate of house break-ins in Extensions 1, 2, 3 and 8, Phase 7 and Motsekuwa were recovered at a house in Extension 2 where the loot is kept for a cooling off period,” said Mohobeleli. He added that by late Thursday, investigators had been to several houses pointed out by the suspects as their previous targets. “One of the youngest suspects was on the run after recently escaping from lawful custody at a centre for minor offenders. He was in for an alleged murder. We have been hard-hit by a proliferation of burglaries in the area. Hopefully, the arrest of these three will see significant declines. Currently, we are revisiting old cases to identify victims and their properties. Our biggest focus though will be people found to have bought stolen goods,” warned Acting Bethlehem Cluster Commander Brigadier Nkaise Molefe.
