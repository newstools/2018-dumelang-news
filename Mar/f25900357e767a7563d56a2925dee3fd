After receiving grant funding of more than R19.5 million from the Department of Trade and Industry, the project that looks at researching and developing a skin-substitute product for use by patients with extensive burns have been awarded exclusively a three-year tender in the Free State to supply the negative pressure therapy product. According to Dr Sibusiso Mahlambi who spearheads the project, they are repositioning themselves in the South African industry as a local medical technology and solutions provider. He told Dumelang News in a telephonic interview that they compete against imported products in the health sector by providing cheaper, good quality alternatives.“We started as a marketer, seller and distributor of products from multi-national companies from 2005. We steadily grew in sales capturing a large market and generating a record revenue exceeding R80 million in 2014,” he said.Mahlambi said at the end of 2016 they were regarded as a fully-fledged and independent company that operates in the medical supplies business.He said t hey focus mainly on wound-care bandages and dressings being textile based. He added that they also aim to develop a locally researched and developed skin substitute product using local technology that would be of the same quality as those currently imported abroad. “Today we have a partnership with a private hospital chain and expanding to other groups supplying wound-care products. The progress we have made in a short period of time is pleasing,” he said.He noted that the local health industry had suffered due to imports leading to a lot of retrenchments in South Africa but plans are far-afoot to address such challenges.
