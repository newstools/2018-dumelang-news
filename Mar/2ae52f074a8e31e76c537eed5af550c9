When Jackson Maguro, a Mozambican national, talks about his art pieces, one gathers that it is as if he speaks of one of his favourite children, given the passion in his eyes and voice. He shared his story with Dumelang News at his workstation near Hilton on the outskirt of Bloemfontein.=“When I came to South Africa some ten years ago, I knew there was a market for my business. You see these babies (referring to his art pieces) are what keeps my family going. I manufacture anything from wood, from vehicles to furniture and it sells quick to people staying in the suburbs,” said Maguro.He told that at the beginning it was hard to secure clients but now he has orders coming from all directions and sometimes he works late night into the night fulfilling them. “There is no day where I do not have work to do, everyday is a business day for my art pieces and I am planning to teach my younger boys that this is a way to go if they want to make it life,” he said. One of his customers who came to collect a wooden truck for his boy child, Gadafi Peterson, said that it was the third piece that he has bought from Maguro and he will continue to support the man. “My kids love these art pieces, they even choose from pictures in magazines and ask me to bring the designs to Maguro for manufacturing,” said Peterson.
