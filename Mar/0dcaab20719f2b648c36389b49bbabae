The lover of a 39-year-old mother has appeared in court on charges of murder after the woman was found murdered and covered in blankets earlier this month in the Mangaung area.The deceased, Palesa Lepheane, a mother to a first year student and a high school pupil, had allegedly left her family home on March 3 and had not been seen since. Her concerned family then informed the police who conducted an investigation. It was then that they discovered her partially decomposed body. The prime suspect in the case was her lover, Mosalane Modise, who was arrested and charged for her murder. He has since appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrates Court and was released on bail. Speaking to Dumelang News this week, close friends to the deceased, Letshego Toolo and Koto Solofelang, said that Palesa was a very friend ly person and they still cannot figure out why would anyone want to kill her in that way. “She will surely be missed. She was one person that would not hurt a fly,” said Toolo.According to police spokesperson, Sergeant Ikobeng Hlubi, Modise was reportedly arrested two days after the police discovered Lepheane’s body. The suspect is expected to rea ppear in court on 24 April. “We cannot further disclose what the police found at the scene,” Hlubi said. It is not clear how Lep­heane was murdered and any motive thereof. The deceased has since been buried in Bloemfontein.Hlubi said family members went to check on the deceased on the night of 4 March as they were gravely concerned as her cellphone was switched off. She said the family said Palesa never switched off her phone or ignored them if she had missed calls on her phone.
