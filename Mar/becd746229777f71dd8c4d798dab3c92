MEC of Police, Roads and Transport, extended his deepest condolences to the families of the deceased and also extended a wish for a speedy recovery to the injured. This came after last week’s courier vehicle lost control on the Deneysville-Jim Fouche road and drove over three road workers while they were on their lunch time.According to police spokesperson, Constable Wendy Nkabi, two female road workers sadly died and one survived with minor injuries. “To the families who lost their loved ones, le ha lefu le le bohloko, empa ke lenqosa le re isang Phomolong e sa feleng. Ka hona tshedisehang! We would also like to wish the injured worker a speedy recovery. We are particularly touched by the manner in which these workers lost their lives while on duty. At the moment, I cannot venture into any speculation but to leave proper investigations to unfold the cause of the accident,” said Mashinini. He said the province is working hard to minimize road fatalities on our roads in support of the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2020 and as government they cann ot achieve that without support and from the public.“We would like to appeal to all drivers to do the best they can to stay alert on the road. Avoid all destructions and rest before embarking on journeys,” he said.
