When she was announced the winner of FameLab 2018 last week, a science based competition for university  students, Emmie Chiyindiko knew that stepping out of her comfort zone was one of the best decisions she has ever made. When Dumelang News spoke to her on Wednesday during a telephonic interview, she was still over the moon. “I am grateful to be reaping the benefits of stepping out of my comfort zone. By facing th e unfamiliar to see what great things I am capable of,” she said.FameLab is the a science communication competition where participants have just three minutes to win over the judges and crowd with a scientific talk that excels in content, clarity and charisma. Contestants from around the world participate, armed only with their wits and a few props. Chiyindiko is doing her master’s degree in Chemistry at the University of the Free State.“My research is based on the synthesis and characterisation of a series of unique metal complexes. These complexes are used both as active pharmaceutical ingredien ts and cosmetic additives to reduce the detrimental effects of UV radiation on the skin. They are incorporated into anti-ulcer, gastro protective drugs, anti-asthmatic, lung disease drugs, with anti-cancer and anti-diabetic agents,” she said.She said with her research she can also monitor air pollution. “Using metal complexes, I am able to monitor the production of formaldehyde and consequently come up with exposure prevention methods,” said Chiyindiko.She believes that it is okay to not fit in.“Mannerisms such as your quirks mak e you different and distinctive. Live your life intentionally, imprint your personal mark on this universe and always choose faith over fear,” she said.She is also the winner of the Three-Minute-Thesis competition for master’s level in 2017.
