Cricket Australia has said that only three players are responsible for the humiliating ball-tampering scandal – David Warner, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft. The players have been sent home and replacements for the fourth test in Johannesburg called up immediately. Tim Paine was officially appointed captain. The findings were revealed by CA boss James Sutherland who arrived in South Africa this week. He was eager to stress that no other players participated in the premeditated attempt to cheat. Darren Lehmann was cleared of wrongdoing and will continue in his role as coach. “The key finding is that prior knowledge was limited to three players, Steve Smith, David Warner, Cameron Bancroft,” Sutherland said. “No other support players had prior knowledge. This also includes Darren Lehmann, who will continue to coach the team.” Disgraced Australian duo Steve Smith and David Warner have been handed 12-month bans as more damning details of their parts in the ball-tampering scandal that has rocked world cricket emerged. The former captain and vice-captain were kicked off Australia's tour of South Africa on Wednesday for cheating in the third Test last weekend. Smith and Warner were stood down as captain and vice-captain after they ordered Cameron Bancroft, who has been banned for nine months, to tamper with the ball with sandpaper - not tape - during the Cape Town Test. As well as their careers being damaged, their wallets will take a hit too as they lose out on millions from playing international cricket. Both Smith and Warner have also been banned from competing in this year's IPL and lose £1.3 million (R 21 564 736,20) contracts. Before the ball-tampering scandal scandal broke, Smith earned £1 million (R16 588 258,61), while Warner took home £750 000 (R12 441 193,96) from their central contracts with Cricket Australia.
