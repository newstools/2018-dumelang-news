He was only eight years old when he discovered that he has a talent as an artist. Today, Lerato Moloi who hails from Bolata in Qwaqwa is a force to be reckoned with.In an interview with the People's Paper, the twenty nine year old “Shuft”, as he is known in his area said he wants to break the mentality that artists die poor.“I also want to preserve a history through my art,” he said. He said he inherited the craft from his stepfather who was an artist too.“So I must say this is something that runs in the family because my mother is also into creativity,” added Lerato.Ler ato said he is happy now that what he got from his parents has turned into a way of living because he is always out there participating in major exhibitions where his works are exhibited. “Artists work alone, we only meet when we engage and share ideas. So I only meet with other artists to plan what we can do for QwaWwa and Free State,” he said.Lerato studied art at the Central University of Technology (CUT) in Bloemfontein. Under his belt, the young man has a national diploma in Art and Design. His  advice for upcoming artists is to have confidence in themselves.“They should dare to be different, they should not do things because other people are doing them,” he motivated.
