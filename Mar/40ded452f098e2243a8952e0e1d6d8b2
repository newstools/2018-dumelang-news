BLOEMFONTEIN-In collaboration with Cricket South Africa (CSA), the Momentum Friendship Games are at schools cricket development initiative that brings players together in a spirit of friendly competition and sportsmanship.The idea is to match teams from well-established cricket playing schools that do not have cricket facilities, but instead are centred around CSA hub or Regional Performance Centre(RCP), where there are facilities, and they receive coaching, support and kit . Grey College cricket team hosted RPC last week ad the home emerged as winners after beating the visitors by 10  wickets.In the 20 overs match in their innings RCP were 76/4 all out whereas the home team managed  78/2.In an interview RPC head coach Sylvestar Motsamai told Dumelang News that friendly matches o that nature, especially with well-established cricket schools, give players new tactics of the game. "We assembled a formidable team, but after this match today we feel that there is still a long way to go before we can match the standard of schools like Grey College.We lost to one of the top teas in schools cricket," said Motsamai. The hubs typically service local schools from the disadvantaged and township communities.Normally these teams would not have a chance to compete, but through the Momentum Friendship Games, they have a chance to test their skills, make new friends and give CSA a chance to spot and nurture talent. These game are not about who wins or loses but more about getting the exposure for the players with the hope of learning from each other.Transformation is about broadening the talent pool and ensuring South Africa becomes a true sporting powerhouse.Whatever the outcomes of the Momentum Games, the values of sportsmanship and friendship are always the winners on match day.Lesego Lekhobo,RCP player who is a grade 8 pupil at Kanalelo Secondary School in Maokeng outside Kroonstad said:"we tried our best but Grey players overpowered us.They were the better team, the experience, skills and tactics they applied totally outplayed us. We are still on the learning curve and I think with better facilities we will improve and become better players," said Lekhobo,
