All that Teboho Molokeng needs is to make sure that his brand, in the next five years, is known country-wide.The young lad from Petsana Township in Reitz in the Nketoana Local Municipality shared his story with Dumelang News.Molokeng who was born and bred in Reitz said he has worked hard for his brand.His brand is called Petsana Reitz Ekasi Production, a T-shirt and cap printing business. “This is the tenth year working on needles and sewing machines but the brand was officially registered last year,” he said.Molokeng said he is happy that residents support his work as he is also able to put bread on the table and send his children to school.“The municipality is also supporting my work,” said the father of three.He insists that even if times are hard, his work will be familiar in the country. “Although there are a lot of challenges in the clothes production industry, I’ll keep on working hard to fulfil my dreams,” he said.Molokeng said he was motivated to sew and print by his cousin who works in Cape Town.“Every at times when I visited him, he would take me out and show me some beautiful handwork done by other artists,” said Molokeng. He added that his career started at school after crafting a beautiful timetable for his teacher and from there everyone at school came and advised him to take his art seriously and until today he is doing what he likes.Molokeng said when he grew up, he wanted to be an electrical engineer.“I am not into this business for money, it’s my hobby. I sometimes donate clothes to the upcoming artists when they go for performances,” he said. He said he would like to assist needy students to register at the higher education institutions in future.“Opportunity comes once in a lifetime. And I have gained a lot of things in this industry, especially because I only had little skills in the beginning,” said Nthofela Mhlambi, a co-worker in the company.He said working with the public needs a person who respects everyone.“Our clients are very important to us because we have what we have today because of them,” said Mhlambi.
