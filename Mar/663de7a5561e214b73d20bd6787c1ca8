The department’s policy prohibits the usage of cellular phones by front office officials while performing their duties,” said Mokgola. He added that the official has been identified and she will be subjected to internal disciplinary processes. Further to this, disciplinary measures have commenced against the three supervisors on the shift for lack of adequate supervision.Meanwhile, Director-General Mkuseli Apleni has expressed his displeasure at the lack of attention paid to the actual duty performed by the official in direct violation of the policy against use of cellular phones at workstations.“Of major concern to me is the fact that the official is dealing with security documents without paying attention to detail and rather preoccupied with her cellular phone. To this end, we have commenced with disciplinary measures against the official and the three supervisors,” said the Director-General.
