Although rural schools in the Free State have limited resources, some have shown that they can perform better despite the challenges. This, at least, is according to MEC of Education, Tate Makgoe. He spoke to Dumelang News last Friday on the sidelines of a celebration of a congratulatory function for the matric class of 2017 which was held at  the Thabo Thokoza Senior Secondary School in Bohlokong, Bethlehem in the local municipality of Dihlabeng. Makgoe expressed his excitement and praise to the district of Thabo Mofutsanyana which he said won his heart through its hard work.“Our pupils didn’t underestimate themselves because of where they come from.They come from rural areas, but they’ve proved that their schools, even though from such a backround,  can defeat the odds,” said Makgoe. The MEC asked parents, teachers and pupils to keep on working together.“We need the support of everyone because this is not an easy task that can only be performed by one person,” said Makgoe.Deputy Principal of Rantsane Senior Secondary School from Makwane in Qwaqwa, Thabo Mohloki, said they will keep on making sure that they produce the best pupils in the country. Mohloki said the school has confidence that it will make it once more in the class of 2018.“Our secret is simple, we start with sleep-overs at school from as early as January each year to ensure that our pupils become familiar with the camps,” said Mohloki.He advised pupils to work even harder than before because the class of grade 12 is different from other grades.Grade 12s need alot more time to study because the workload is alot more compared to other grades,” said Mohloki.
