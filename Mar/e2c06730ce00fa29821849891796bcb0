Motheo District has begun with their zones playoffs, as the under 12 soccer teams from various primary schools get their Danone Nations Cup tournament underway. Schools from the five zones of the South African Schools Football Association (SASFA) in Motheo –  Bloemfontein, Botshabelo, Thaba Nchu, Mantsopa and Naledi – have brought their A game as early as now to reach the next round. This weekend, schools enter into the knockout stages, with a host of fixtures set to take place at the B Section ground in Botshabelo on Friday, amongst others. Following this round, the Regional finals will take centre stage on April 21 in Thaba Nchu followed by the Provincial battle on May 5 in the City of Roses. Mefereka Fanyane, the president of SASFA Motheo, believes the district has enough quality to produce the best team that will go as far as the nationals, citing what transpired at the provincial level last year. "We did well last year, we had our school (Brebner Primary) go all the way to the finals, but only to be knocked out by their counterparts from Thabo Mofutsanyane. All eyes were on Brebner to move to the national level, but that didn't happen," he told Dumelang Sport. He added: "Brebner is available against this year, and we're hoping that they do well this year, but overall we want to have a team that's going to represent us well and go all out. However, right now our focus is on getting past the local phase first.” Learners participating in the tournament must have been born between January 2006 and December 2007.
