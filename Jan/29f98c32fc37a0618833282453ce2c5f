Bloemfontein Celtic continued their winless streak when they played out to a goalless draw with Amazulu in their midweek clash, but are eager to capitalising on home-ground advantage this weekend against Cape Town City. Celtic and Usuthu clashed at the King Zwelithini Stadium in Durban, with the visitors seeking redemption following a defeat in their last game while the hosts targeted their second-win in a row. The man at the helm, Veselin Jelusic admitted that not getting a win on the road is becoming a concern, but is confident things will turn around. “In the previous matches, our approach has been offensive; we wanted to scored, we wanted to win, but we didn’t. But we continue to work hard.” Apart from being winless in away matches this year, Celtic have also not scored in their last three encounters. The last time they scored away was in a 4-1 loss to Mamelodi Sundowns in December. This weekend they return to the slaughter house, where they did not only taste their last victory, but also got the first win of the year, to face the Citizens. Following the result, Celtic occupy the ninth spot with 24 points from 18 matches and they come into the home match high in confidence following a victory in the reverse fixture back in October. However they will surely look to tread carefully against the team from Mother City, who come from a Cape Town derby win against Ajax last weekend. Kickoff at the Dr. Molemela Stadium on Sunday is at 15:30.
