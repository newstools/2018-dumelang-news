MutliChoice has announced that it will not be renewing ANN7’s contract when it expires in August. Instead, MultiChoice will be looking for a new black-owned TV channel. During a briefing on Wednesday, CEO Calvo Mawela said they made mistakes in the past and added there was no corruption. “Mistakes were made, with regards to lobbying process and failure to do due diligence, but there was no evidence of corruption or illegal activity.” Mawela said following their internal investigation, they apologise for the mistakes that were made regarding its relationship with ANN7. “In light of the ongoing controversies, it will not be appropriate to renew ANN7's current contract when it ends in August. Instead, we are starting the process of looking for a new black-owned news channel,” said Mawela. He added that payments made to ANN7 and other TV channels were not abnormal and had nothing to do with its stance on digital migration. MultiChoice continues to believe that the wide range of foreign and local news channels on its platform, representing widely divergent views, needs to be supplemented with another local voice.
