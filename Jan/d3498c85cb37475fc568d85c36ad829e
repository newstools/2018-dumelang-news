The Cheetahs and the Kings are gearing up to face off this weekend in Port Elizabeth in a much-anticipated maiden South African derby in the Guinness Pro 14 competition, with the visitors expecting an uphill battle despite the hosts' recurring struggles. Upon their return from the festive break, both sides suffered away losses to Benetton and Edinburgh respectively; the results which ensured they remained at the third and bottom spots in their respective conferences. The men from the Friendly City have endured a disappointing run on their debut season in the European competition, losing 10 of the 11 matches they have played thus far. As for the Cheetahs, it has been a pleasing season for Rory Duncan's men with six wins and five defeats under their belt. With both sides still have two games in hand, nothing will please the men from the City of Roses more than collecting maximum points in their next two matches to solidify their top three spot. The Cheetahs are well aware of the poor run the winless Kings have been enduring and how much they might rely on this game to turn their fortunes around, but the skipper, Torsten van Jaarsveld said they too have a mission. "We've also been in the situation they've been in. We know how it feels to lose so many games in a row and you wait for one game. I think they've been waiting for this game and they're going to try and measure themselves against us," the Cheetahs' van Jaarsveld told Dumelang Sport. He is anticipating a very physical contest between the former Super Rugby contenders, but says they are prepared for it. "We've done well throughout the season, going week by week and not looking ahead. This is the week we've been waiting for; it's the SA Conference game. It's going to be a tough game from the start of it. They'll come out guns blazing, and so are we." Kickoff at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday is at 5pm.
