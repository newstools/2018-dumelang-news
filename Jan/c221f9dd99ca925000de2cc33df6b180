Free State Fashion Week help fashion lovers realize their dreams The Free State Fashion Hub is a Fashion Design Institution in Bloemfontein, South Africa that provides theoretical grounding and practical experience in the Clothing Design and Manufacturing industry.  The Hub, founded after organisers of the Free State Fashion Week realized the impact they were having on the community after initiating the annual event two years ago. With the amount of interest and talent showed by our local designers and the lack of places where they could get accredited for their passions, the idea was born and is currently seeking to develop local talent and educate students with a tertiary qualification. “We didn’t want everything to end with the glitz and glamour on the runway, we realized that the effects of fashion week needed to have a lasting impact on the youth in our community” – Candy Smith (CEO & Founder)  Established in 2017 Free State Fashion Week Hub was created to contribute to skills development of unemployed youth in the Free State area, targeting the under privileged previously disadvantaged individuals to alleviate poverty and increase entrepreneurship and job creation. The school offers part time classes on Saturdays designed for upskilling general knowledge of the clothing and manufacturing industry to develop Fashion Designers who are equipped with entrepreneurial skills to survive and grow in this constantly evolving industry. The school will also be doing recognition of prior learning (RPL) for individuals who gained formal, informal and non-formal learning, against a set of outcomes in a formal course study or a set of workplace or social competencies.  The hub also makes tailor garments for special events and sells unique fabrics which is available for viewing at  8 Reid Street, Corporate Park, Westdene.  Registrations are still open for the 2018 academic year and students interested in enrolling can go to their website for more information on the application process, www.freestatefashionweekhub.co.za or call 051 011 9183
