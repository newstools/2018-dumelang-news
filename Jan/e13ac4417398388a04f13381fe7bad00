PSL action continues in the coming weekend and, with the January transfer window still in full flight, fans will be eager to see whether their clubsâ€™ new signing will be on show. Several teams have made key acquisitions to bolster their squads since the last round of fixtures, most notably tonight (Friday, 19 January), Bidvest Wits and Bloemfontein Celtic, will face each other at the Bidvest Stadium at 8pm. The home side are still in the red zone and will have their work cut out for them as they take on a side reeling from a heavy 4-0 defeat to Maritzburg United in their last outing.Saturday afternoon sees Maritzburg United, fresh off a midweek defeat, travel to Bethlehem to take on second place Free State Stars at Goble Park. The ground has been somewhat of a fortress of the home side and they will hope to keep the momentum going as a win would see them level on points with table topping Sundowns.
