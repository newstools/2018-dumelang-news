Proteas fast bowler Kagiso Rabada hopes to maintain his position at the top of the ICC test-bowling rankings with consistent performances throughout the season.Rabada became only the seventh South African bowler to top the latest rankings released on Tuesday following his contribution in the 72-run win against India in the first Sunfoil test match at PPC Newlands.The 22-year-old has made a meteoric rise since his debut against India in 2015, and recently became the youngest bowler to take 100 wickets for South Africa. He hopes to “maintain performances” in the green and gold, but most importantly, continue to improve on his role within the attack. “It feels great to be at the top of the rankings,” he said on Wednesday. “ It is what I have always wanted to do, hopefully I can keep doing what I’m doing and keep trying to win games for the team. I want to keep getting better and better. “There is always something new that you can work on,” he said. The Proteas face the Indians again on Saturday, when the 2nd test will kick off in Pretoria.
