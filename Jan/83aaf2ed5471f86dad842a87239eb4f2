The South African comedian Loyiso Madinga  is the latest local act to fly the flag high after bagging himself a spot on America's popular talk show, The Daily Show. Loyiso was unveiled as the show's newest African correspondent and was hand-picked by fellow South African and show host,  Trevor Noah. "As wild as Donald Trump is for America, many countries around the world have Trumps of their own and since The Daily Show is in many countries, we thought, why not give each country a chance to show off their stable geniuses?" said Trevor. Loyiso has been making waves in the industry after leaving a career in advertising to pursue his dream. In 2012, the young comedian won the Graça Comedy Showdown and in 2014, went on to receive the Savanna Newcomer Award. Local viewers can expect to see Loyiso's first segment – from the  ANC elective conference – on Comedy Central on January 11.
