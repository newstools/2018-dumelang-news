TVET colleges are not for underperforming students. The marketing and communications manager of Maluti TVET colleges, Makhala Moloi-Labase told Dumelang News when she slamed the allegations that the universities are for the geniuses. "We cannot compare the universities with TVET colleges because one is offering more practical work while another one offers lot of theoretical work," she said. She also mentioned that students must stand up on time and register their courses of choice. "Even though we advise them to come and register their courses, but we're worried of the way they make choices of subjects. Looks like they follow each other because of friendship they have, " said Moloi-Labase. She added that the campuses are trying harder to make students understand the backbone of economy in the Eastern Free State. "They all want to study office work rather than balancing their studies with the agricultural sector, " said Moloi-Labase. Some of the students point out their views which seemed to show unhappiness towards the registration process. “I have been here from in the early hours of Tuesday but till in the afternoon there was lot of cues,” said Lerato Nkopane (19). She said she was hungry to study Human Resource Management said her dream is to be admitted in the college. On the other hand Thabang Mosia said he believes that he will succeed in his Public Relations course.   A 20 year old said if he won't get an opportunity to register his courses this year, it will be another year of waste in his life.
