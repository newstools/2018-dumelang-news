BLOEMFONTEIN - A silver Mahindra KUV overturned along Zastron Street earlier yesterday in the afternoon. According to the driver of the Nissan bakkie, everything happened rather quickly after the KUV hit his bakkie on the driver’s side then veered to the right where it ploughed into a stationary Nissan car before flipping over and landing on its roof. The lady who was driving the KUV escaped with no physical injuries. Meanwhile, traffic congestion was experienced along Zastron Street and First Avenue as emergency services attend to the scene. Police spokesperson, Brigadier Motantsi Makhele confirmed that an accident occurred in Bloemfontein’s busiest roads but said no one was seriously injured.  He however said police were investigating the cause of the accident, therefore at the time of going to print, details of the accident were still sketchy.
