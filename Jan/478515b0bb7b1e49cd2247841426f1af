A grand occasion for some, a drag for others; the first day back at school for the start of  the 2018 academic year was as colourful and eventful for all pupils as far as first day back to school goes. Parents did their best to beat the ‘bell’ and get their little ones to school on time, setting the tone for them to rise and shine. Local mother, Gaogakwe Botsime had no trouble getting her little girl, Oarabile Vuma (5) to Relebelletse Primary School based at Phase 4, in Mangaung Bloemfontein, on time. Oarabile was all too keen to get started on her life’s great academic journey. “Oarabile was so anxious to get to school. She asked me over and over again when school was opening. To her, Wednesday was so far away but she is excited now that it is finally here. She wants to go to school and learn hard so that when she grows up, she can be a doctor,” Mom Gaogakwe said. Teachers shared little Oarabile’s enthusiasm. Grade 1 teacher, Mamaki Phalatsane, said she was delighted with her grade 1 pupils.  “Our grade 1 learners rarely give us any problems. They cope well with the new adjustment because most of them come from pre-schools. There are still a few that cry but the majority of them really enjoy school,” Phalatsane said. Amanada Fourie, a grade R teacher at Grey College Pre-primary school, shared the same sentiments. “There are a few pupils who struggle with the adjustment to school, but as time goes by they get the hang of it and learn to cope.  It’s been smooth sailing on the first day back so far and everyone is happy to be here,” she said.
