Thursday’s scheduled 2 day ANC NEC meeting which got underway in Pretoria is the first formal meeting of the highest decision-making body of the governing party since its elective conference in December 2017. President Jacob Zuma’s future is not an issue of discussion at the  NEC , at least according to the party’s Secretary General Ace Magashule. The new ANC leadership met in East London last week to draft the January 8 statement. The pressing issues facing the organisation will only be effectively dealt with in the Pretoria gathering. While speculation is rife about President Jacob Zuma’s future, the ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule says this issue is not part of the discussion. Although other issues up for discussion include the appointment of the National Working Committee and the chairpersons of various sub committees, Magashule says this gathering will also decide on the future of KwaZulu-Natal and the Free State Provincial Executive Committees. The ANC Secretary General also says they will also tackle the ongoing issue of racism in schools.   The Gauteng Education Department took the Afrikaans school Hoërskool Overvaal in Vereeniging to court in a bid to force it to admit 55 English speaking pupils This relates instances where learners have not been placed due to language issues. The ANC will soon roll out the January 8 statement celebrations across the provinces and regions.
