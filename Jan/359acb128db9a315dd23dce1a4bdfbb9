South Africa have risen three places in the latest Fifa World Rankings released on Thursday, up to number 78 in the world and number 17 in Africa. It is still well below the stated aim of the South African Football Association, whose mission is to see the side regularly in the top 20 in the world and top three in Africa. Despite not kicking a ball, South Africa made the move as the rankings are calculated over the previous four years, with each year given a different weighting, starting with the highest for the most recent. Tunisia have moved into top spot on the continent, followed by Senegal, Egypt, Morocco and DR Congo in the top five.
