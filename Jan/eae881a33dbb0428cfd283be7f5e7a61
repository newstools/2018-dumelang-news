Tumahole is a community that is very rich in talent. In fact, very well known people like Jerry Phele, Ace Magashule, Tokelo Rantie, just to mention a few,come from the dusty township known as Tumahole. Like most communities in South Africa crime, substance abuse and gangsterism are very rife in that community. Concerned youth activist and philanthropist, Edgar Legoale has taken the initiative to host a soccer challange to unite communities that are divided due to gangsterism boarders. The challange will see young people in different sections coming together to form soccer teams that will play for massive prizes . "The Edgar Legoale Knockout Soccer Challenge (ELKSC) is a community programme with the purpose of fighting the societal ills and challenges such as drug abuse and gangsterism which are facing our youth. We believe that we have a responsibility to fight gangsterism and drugs in our communities and that the responsibility cannot be left to attention of the government alone,"said tournament organiser Edgar Legaole. This programme was aimed at attracting youth from all corners in Tumahole but due to the massive response and support it has received, it has been extended to include youth and teams from neighbouring townships. We want to give life and meaning to the saying “It takes a village to raise a child”. Together, will help keep our youth off the streets and away from gangsterism and drugs. The soccer challenge awareness campaigns will be hosted this weekend at Mandela Stadium,near Boitlamo Secondary School. Twelve teams will the participating in the tournament which will include:eight teams competing for the prizes stakeholders will see four teams and no prizes but in support of the programme.
