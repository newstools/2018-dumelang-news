Making a debut is one thing, but scoring in that match is another and that is what Neo Maema almost achieved in his first start in Bloemfontein Celtic senior team colours, much to the delight of his coach, Veselin Jelusic. The 22-year-old attacker lined up for Phunya Sele Sele in their 2-1 home victory against Golden Arrows last week and came close to netting his first goal when his second half shot went wide of goal. Despite missing that chance, the former Celtic Multichoice Diski Challenge side's midfielder is confident of the future. "I was disappointing with the chance I missed, but it'll come right in the next game." He adds: "I'd like to thank the chairman and management for this opportunity and I'll reward them with hard work."He reflects on his debut:Â  "The coach told me to push, not put myself under pressure. At the beginning, I was shaky, but the senior guys had some encouraging words." Jelusic was also satisfied with Maema's performance, saying the introduction of youngsters is good for the team. "It's not only about the results, it's also about giving chance to a few youngsters, exciting players to promote themselves," he says. Another product of the development, Kabelo Dlamini, also tasted a top flight league when he came on as a substitute in the second stanza.
