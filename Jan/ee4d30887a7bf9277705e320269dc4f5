The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is poised to serve preservation orders on Gupta-linked Trillian and global consultancy McKinsey. However‚ the NPA has denied that it was planning to seize Gupta assets on Tuesday‚ contrary to media reports late on Monday.  The preservation orders are for assets to the value of R1.6bn‚ in relation to work both companies did for state-owned power utility Eskom and were approved by NPA director Shaun Abrahams. Suspended head of legal compliance for Eskom, Suzanne Daniels, issued letters of demand to McKinsey and Trillian in October‚ also to the value of R1.6bn — the amount collectively paid to both. According to NPA spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku the application was received on December 14. “The papers were supposed to be served tomorrow and then we would have communicated after they were served.” According to Mfaku after the orders were served‚ Trillian and McKinsey would have 90 days to defend them. The onus would be on the companies to prove how they lawfully obtained the assets and if they failed to do so‚ applications would be made to seize the assets‚ at which point the Asset Forfeiture Unit would step in. Eskom in the letters of demand argued that the contract between it and both companies was unlawful as‚ according to the National Treasury‚ McKinsey’s and Trillian’s fees were supposed to be paid at an hourly rate‚ and not percentages. The move marks the first strike by the NPA against some of the players involved in state capture. A source in the AFU‚ with knowledge of the case‚ said what had been issued was a freezing order. “This is to secure primarily bank accounts‚ the majority of which are accounts based overseas.” He said such orders would see a curator being appointed by a court who would‚ with their team‚ locate all local and foreign assets.
