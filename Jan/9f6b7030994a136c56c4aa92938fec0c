The South African Students Council (Sasco) in the district's municipality of Thabo Mofutsanyana is doing everything in its power to help its members. "We're very glad to find that students are coming in their numbers to register for the accommodation in the higher education institutions, " said Sasco chairperson in the district, Emmanuel Polokoane. He said most of the students studying in Qwaqwa were from distant places and were struggling to secure accommodation on their own."As the council, we are proud to say we've helped many students to embark on their studying journey with no fear of a lack of accommodation," said Polokoane. He said the only serious challenge they have is that some students have an outstanding balance and it becomes difficult to overcome this problem. "People who help us with the tertiary tuitions, want to help students who have no debts at school,‚Äù he said. He said they are ensuring that all Maluti Tvets and one university campus in Qwaqwa are on their list to be attended. "Our intention is to make sure that there's safety on campuses. We're getting tired of students are being attacked and eventually being killed while on their way back or to school, " he said. Polokwane urged everyone to donate whatever they have in order to be used by the needy students. Eunice Ramathe, who is a second year student at the university of the Free State in Qwaqwa campus, thanked Sasco for its efforts. She said that if it wasn't for Sasco, she would not be fulfilling her dream of studying.
