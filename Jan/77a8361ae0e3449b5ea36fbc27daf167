At least fifteen thousand families were happy on saturday after receiving the food parcels. The Charles Mopedi stadium at Ha-Sethunya village in Qwaqwa was filled with residents to receive their packages. Lesedi Mapheto, director of Lesedi 7 group said the initiative of giving out food parcels is a sign of caring for needy people. Mapheto said this initiative is in partnership with Church of Christ which its mission is to fight hunger. "We believe in philosophy of helping people to go to sleep with something in the stomach. We also understand that a slice of bread is better than nothing, " said Mapheto. He said residents were given the tickets of receiving their food parcels on thursday."Giving out such number of tickets to the residents on the weekdays shows that lot of people are unemployed in this area, " said Mapheto. He added that even though some people took the tickets whilst there are food at their homes but that doesn't matter because mission is to help government to fight poverty. He said this initiative will come back in few months for a job creation in the area. "We don't want to see people always begging for food, we want them to work and be able to buy themselves food for their families, " he said. MMC for women, children and people living with disability in the local municipality of Maluti A Phofung, Masetjhaba Mosia-Lakaje denied the allegations that there are some leaders of the ruling party in this initiative. Mosia-Lakaje thanked those who made this a successful initiative of helping needy residents. Madisebo Molekoane said her family will be happy with the food parcels she got. "Thanks for everything they've gave us because hunger is killing us," said a 43 year old Madisebo.
